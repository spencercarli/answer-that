        <h1>What's the point?</h1>
        <p>I like to write things down. I feel it makes me notice things more throughout the day and reflecting on my day helps me process things. However, I have a standard set of questions. Once I'm a few weeks into answering the same questions time and time again I start noticing less and, as I review what I write, I see I just start to write the same things again and again.</p>
        <p>That's where <em>Answer That</em> comes in. We'll send you a new, randomly selected question, each day. This allows you to notice and reflecting on something new each and everyday.</p>
